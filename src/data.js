      ' I like it’s simplicity. However the coffee served is not simple at all. The wonderful barista explains the way to best enjoy the super ice latte. They “removed” water from the milk to leave the creamy milk for the exquisite taste of cafe latte! Brilliant! Another to die for is the TKG, it’s rice with truffle oil, caviar and raw egg. ',
